 - Here are some notes from Facebook
  - Image Sizes
    - Use images that are at least 1200 x 630 pixels for the best display on high resolution devices. At the minimum, you should use images that are 600 x 315 pixels to display link page posts with larger images.
  - Small Images
    - If your image is smaller than 600 x 315 px, it will still display in the link page post, but the size will be much smaller.
